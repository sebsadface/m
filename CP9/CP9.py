### Problem 1
### Use solve_ivp to solve the Fitzhugh-Nagumo IVP
### For the maxima use the plot to narrow down the times you use to search
### for the maximum.




### Problem 2
### Use solve_ivp to solve the Chua equation
### You can tell something is chaotic if it is seemingly random
### If it looks like all solutions tend toward a point or a circle it is
### not chaotic.



### Problem 3
### Part 1: Finite Differences
### Use finite differences to solve the BVP
### Be careful about the shape of the vectors, you may have to transpose to
### get the correct shape.  It's a good idea to print the solutions out to
### make sure the shape is correct.



### Part 2: Bisection
### Use the shooting method to solve the BVP
### It's a good idea to test out a few in the command window first to make
### sure that your initial conditions gets you to different sides of the right
### boundary condition.
### Use the plot to help you figure out what your choices of initial
### conditions should be
