import numpy as np

# Problem 1
# Initialize A, B, C, x, y, and z as numpy arrays.  Then do the calculations for A1 to A5






# Problem 2
# Initialize x using linspace and y using arrange.  Reshape each to take the form of a vector (a single row 2-D array).
# Set the variables A6 and A7, and do the calculations for A8 to A10
# Note:  if you ever have the need to assign a particular variable, say x to say A6, use A6 = x.copy() to be safe.






# Problem 3 Part 1a
# Initialize P0, K, and r.  Calculate P1, P2, and P3.  Save P3 as A11.






# Problem 3 Part 1b
# Reinitialize P0, K, and r.  Calculate P1, P2, P3, and P4.  Save P4 as A12.
# Here we don't have to worry about pointers.






# Problem 3 Part 2a
# Reinitialize P0, K, and r.  Calculate P1, P2, and P3.  Save P3 as A13.
# Here we don't have to worry about pointers.






# Problem 3 Part 2b
# Reinitialize P0, K, and r.  Calculate P1, P2, P3, and P4.  Save P4 as A14.
# Here we don't have to worry about pointers.






# Problem 3 Part 2c
# Don't think too hard about this one.  No calculations will be necessary.  Save your educated guess as A15
