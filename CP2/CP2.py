### Problem 1
### Initialize A as a 20 by 21 matrix of zeros (Week 2 Lecture 1)
### To fill in the matrix create a nested for loop (Week 2 Lecture 1)
### Save the matrix A as the variable A1
### Don't forget to use .copy()





### Let B equal A, and set the entire 15th row as zero (Week 1 Lecture 3)
### Do the same thing for the entire 16th column
### Save the matrix B as A2
### Don't forget to use .copy()





### For A3, since we want the last few columns/rows you want to use negative
### values to go backwards through the circular queue (Week 1 Lecture 3)





### Set A4 as the 10th column of B (Week 1 Lecture 3)
### reshape it into a column vector






### Problem 2
### For A5 and A6 it's exactly like Week 2 Theory lecture.





### For A7 through A10 you're still doing a Sum as you did for A5 and A6
### but now you want to break out of the loop when the sum surpasses 10
### for A7 and A8, and 20 for A9 and A10
### (very similar to Week 2 Lecture 2 Fibonacci)






### Problem 3
### Create a function here (Week 2 Lecture 3).  The function will take r,
### x0, and N as inputs and output a vector x of all N iterates starting at
### x0.  Inside the function create a loop that calculates the value of the
### logistic map and saves it in its respective entries of x.





### Set N and x0 according to the assignment file




### For each of the next three set its respective r value.  Then set the
### vector x as the iterates of the logistic map using the output of the
### function you created.

### Write the code for A11 and A12 here



### Do the same as above except for A13 and A14



### Do the same as above except for A15 and A16
