%%% Problem 1
%%% Initialize t, and x_true





%%% Forward Euler
%%% Write a forward Euler scheme




%%% Backward Euler
%%% Write a backward Euler scheme





%%% Built-in Solver
%%% Use ode45
%%% Don't forget to transpose the solution you get from ode45.





%%% Problem 2
%%% Initialize the parameters




%%% Forward Euler for dt = 0.01
%%% Initialize t and x_true
%%% Write a forward Euler scheme





%%% Forward Euler dt = 0.001
%%% Reinitialize t and x_true
%%% Write a forward Euler scheme





%%% Predictor-Corrector dt = 0.01
%%% Reinitialize t and x_true
%%% Write a forward Euler scheme and a backward Euler scheme in the same
%%% loop.
%%% The forward Euler scheme is the predictor.  The answer from forward
%%% Euler will be plugged into the sin(x_n+1) in the backward Euler scheme.
